# Simple Web builder

A template **only** to be used as a basic & simpl*ish* web kickstarter. 

Based on this [article](https://stagerightlabs.com/blog/you-might-not-need-laravel-mix) I decided to have a template repository to start from. 

For now it is only for sketching componentes, layouts or testing new tools.

## Stack used

- ESbuild
- Yarn
- NodeJS
- eslint
- Javascript ES6
- SASS, SCSS compilation
- Nginx, Docker
